    <!-- about the product-->
    <div id='Info' style='display: none;'>
        <p> Thanks for using my extension! <br>
            Have you ever felt like you just need to be kept honest with your internet use?<br>
            That you could accomplish so much more, if you just stayed off your habit websites? <br>
            That you just mindlessly key into a new tab, hit the same url, and doomscroll through the same front
            page
            9001
            times a day? <br>
            <br>
            Habituated internet usage is an addiction to the dopamine high from pushing a happy button over and over
            every
            day, every hour, every minute.<br>
            And anyone knows that trying to quit a behavior cold turkey begs most people to fail.<br>
            <br>
            If your habits are anything like mine were, The Procrastination Buster can be your baby step towards
            rehabilitation. It acts as a tool to wean off your problem sites, where you can restrict access for a period
            of time that you choose, with the flexibility to choose the amount of time you think it's appropriate to
            spend on them. <br>
            <br>
            The Procrastination Buster is not parental advisory software. <br>
            This is a product for people who want help in policing their own behavior, not in policing others'.
            <br>
            You can name up to 10 websites to restrict your usage.<br>
            You choose the amount of time you want to be allowed on your problem websites, <br>
            and you choose the amount of time you Don't want to be allowed on the sites. <br>
            It's as simple as that. <br>
            <br>
            I built this extension for myself because I just got sick of spending so much extra time in my day on
            reddit.<br>
            In the past I've allowed my internet usage habits to get the better of me, especially when pursuing
            academics. <br>
            So now that I'm learning how to code and trying to shift careers, I wanted to build this product as a test
            of my skills, with the added benefit of curbing my internet habits and honing my focus. <br>
            <!-- this ending sucks, re do it.-->
            Whereas in the past my academic endeavors have been thwarted by my internet usage habits, <br>
            I'm determined to make changes and be more successful in the future. <br>
            <br>
            In building this product I've been able to help myself, and if it's able to help you too, I'm overjoyed.
            <br>
            Good luck to you in your future endeavors! <br>
            -Tyler

    <!-- mention that this is built with the newest manifest v3 extension-->
    <!-- mention that it's fast from the declarative net requests?-->

    <!-- faq-->
    <div id='FAQ' style='display: none;'>
        <h2>
            <button id='faqB1'>v</button>
            Why am I not receiving notifications from my extension?
        </h2>
        <!-- way to toggle these answers on and off?-->
        <p id='faq1' style='display: none;''>First, check that you have any websites restricted on the extension. Click the "User Settings" button above,
            and your restricted websites should be listed. <br>
            If you' re not seeing notifications when registering or unregistering websites to your extension, or when
            visiting your restricted websites you should check your notification settings on your windows device for
            chrome. <br>
            for windows this is in settings -> system -> notifications and actions. <br>
            On that page make sure that you have "get notifications from apps" turned on and notifications for
            chrome
            turned
            on. </p>

        <h2> <button id='faqB2'>v</button> Why isn't the extension doing anything?</h2>
        <p id='faq2' style='display: none;'> If you haven't registered any websites to your extension try doing that
            first. <br>
            There is the possibility that your extension has become inactive for some reason, <br>
            <!-- might be able to fix this by just pulling up sync settings on action click-->
            so to check that try restarting the extension by going to chrome://extensions in your chrome browser,
            <br>
            finding the Procrastination Buster in your list of extensions, and clicking the slider to turn it off
            and
            turn
            it on again.
        </p>
        <!-- pic of chrome extension page-->

        <h2> <button id='faqB3'>v</button> Why can't I see the extension icon in chrome?</h2>
        <p id='faq3' style='display: none;'> Chrome recently updated their extensions hiding all newly installed
            extensions in the puzzle piece icon
            to
            the
            right of the omnibar. <br>
            <!-- need to add pic here of omnibar puzzle piece-->
            If you click the puzzle piece it should bring up a list of all of your enabled extensions. <br>
            Find the Procrastination Buster icon
            <!-- pic of icon--> and click the pin next to it so that it is highlighted blue.
        </p>
        <!-- or just show the dropdown menu with it turned blue-->

        <h2> <button id='faqB4'>v</button> When my websites are blocked where can I see how much time I have left?</h2>
        <p id='faq4' style='display: none;'> Unfortunately this was a feature planned during development, to have the
            'active' badge on the extension icon display how much time was remaining before you could access your site.
            <br>
            The feature was too consumptive on memory and demanding of the browser, so this feature was foregone, and
            you can only see whether or not your restricted sites are being
            actively blocked.<br>
            In order to see this feature make sure you have the extension pinned to your taskbar.
        </p>
        <!--don't know if i'm going to incorporate this feature-->

        <h2> <button id='faqB5'>v</button> I uninstalled my extension in the middle of a block period, and now my
            restricted sites are blocked
            forever??
        </h2>
        <p id='faq5' style='display: none;'> Well, that's what you get for cheating yourself! <br>
            Just kidding lol <br>
            This error was encountered during testing and a fix was implemented into the installation code. <br>
            All you have to do is reinstall the Procrastination Buster extension, which will clear all of your
            actively
            blocked urls. <br>
            Once you've reinstalled, uninstall the extension before navigating to any of your restricted websites.
            <br>
            You should be able to browse regularly.
